# ConText in Scala

This is a translation of the pyConTextNLP algorithm to Scala so that we can run it on a JVM. We are also modifying the code to take a more functional programming approach.

## Expected Dependencies

* [Graph for Scala](http://www.scala-graph.org/)

## Issues

* Cannot get word boundary metacharacter to work in regular expressions 
    * Tested regular expressions in scala interactive shell and [on-line regex tester](http://java-regex-tester.appspot.com/)
